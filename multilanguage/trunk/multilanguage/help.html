<h3>Plugin overview</h3>

<p>This plugin allows a site to be set up to support multiple language translations.
NP_MultiLanguage relies on the <a href="http://wiki.nucleuscms.org/text" title="NP_Text">NP_Text</a> plugin
to translate in skins and the Item Body part of templates. NP_MultiLanguage allows for translations of items,
categories, and templates. It also provides two means for visitors to switch between languages.
</p>
<p>Beware that there is still considerable work involved to make a multi-language site,
but this plugin provides the tools.</p>

<h3><a name="requirements">Requirements</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>Nucleus CMS v3.33 or higher</li>
<li>NP_Text v0.53 or higher (provided with download of this plugin)</li>
<li>A skin that is internationalized using NP_Text (you may need to do this yourself)</li>
<li>As of Nucleus v3.33, some modifications to a couple core files. This requirement will
go away with a future version of Nucleus. (See Installation for details).</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="upgrading">Upgrading</a></h3>
To upgrade from from 1.01 to 1.02, just replace the old files with the new files. Then on the Plugins Management page, click the <code>Update Subscriptions</code> button.
<p />

<h3><a name="installation">Installation</a></h3>

<p>The NP_MultiLanguage plugin can be downloaded from
<a href="http://revcetera.com/ftruscot/downloads/nucleus_plugins.html" title="Download NP_MultiLanguage">here</a>.</p>

<p>Download and extract the zip file. Copy the NP_MultiLanguage.php file and the
multilanguage directory to the nucleus/plugins directory.</p>

<p>For Nucleus version of 3.33, replace nucleus/libs/BLOG.php with the nucleus/plugins/multilanguage/BLOG.php file supplied with the plugin.
It is a good idea to backup your file before making the change. This will add a needed plugin API event to allow us access to translate categories
in the categorylists. These changes are committed to be included in a future release of Nucleus CMS.</p>

<p>For Nucleus version of 3.33, replace nucleus/libs/TEMPLATE.php with the nucleus/plugins/multilanguage/TEMPLATE.php file supplied with the plugin.
It is a good idea to backup your file before making the change. This will add a needed plugin API event to allow us access to use different templates
for different languages. These changes are committed to be included in a future release of Nucleus CMS.</p>

<p>Use the Nucleus Admin GUI to register the NP_MultiLanguage plugin into Nucleus.</p>

<p>You will need to edit and save the plugin options before using the plugin.
The options are described below.</p>

<p>You will need to also visit the admin page for NP_MultiLanguage to define your
languages before doing most the other stuff. See <a href="#def_languages">Defining Languages</a></p>

<h3><a name="options">Plugin Options</a></h3>
<p>There are two options that control the operation of the MultiLanguage plugin.
These options are set from the &lsquo;edit options&rsquo; link in the Plugin
Admin area.</p>

<h4>Plugin Options</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>Show Admin Area in quick menu</code> : Whether the MultiLanguage admin area
should be shown in the Quick Menu area. yes or no. (yes)</li>
<li><code>Delete NP_MultiLanguage data tables on uninstall?</code> : Whether the database
table should be deleted on an uninstall. This should be set to &lsquo;yes&rsquo;
only when permanently removing NP_MultiLanguage. yes or no. (no)</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="skinvars">SkinVars</a></h3>

<p>The skinvar should be valid in all skin types. It is used to display a language chooser on your page.</p>

<p>The skinvar has the form: <b>&lt;%MultiLanguage(<i>type</i>)%&gt;</b>
<br />where <i>type</i> is:<br />
<ul>
<li><code>dropdown</code> : displays dropdown field used by site visitors to select languages.</li>
<li><code>list</code> :  displays flags for each language in a list allowing visitors to click a flag to select a language.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The list form of the skinvar can be styled using CSS to control how it appears in your skin. For example, I use the
following code in the CSS file for the shades skin to display the languages horizontally across the top right of the header.</p>

<pre><code>
/* for NP_MultiLanguage flag list */
.mllistli {
	list-style-image: none;
	list-style-type: none;
	display: inline;
}

.mllistul{
	padding: 0px 20px 0px 10px;
    text-align: right;
	float: right;
}

.mllistli a {
	color: #888;
	display: inline;
	line-height: 10px;
	text-decoration: none;
	width: 20px;
}

.mllistli a:hover {
	color: #888;
	display: inline;
	line-height: 10px;
	text-decoration: none;
	width: 20px;
	background-color: transparent;
}
</code></pre>

<h3><a name="def_languages">Defining Languages</a></h3>

<p>Each language you want to use on your site must be defined on the admin page for NP_MultiLanguage.
Defining languages is easy. You will need to click on the Languages tab of the admin page. It is best
to define the native language of your site first. This is the language used in the original items and categories.
If you don't define it, it will not appear in the language selectors output by the skinvar.</p>

<p>To add a new language, click the Add New Language button. You will need to complete the following fields: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>Language</code> : This is the name of the language file (without the extension) used for this language
by <a href="http://wiki.nucleuscms.org/text" title="NP_Text">NP_Text</a>. For example, if NP_Text is using french-utf8.php,
the name of the language here should be french-utf8, english.php would be english, etc... This is important so that the
cookie used by NP_Text will be set correctly by the NP_MultiLanguage skinvars.</li>
<li><code>Display Name</code> : A friendly name for this language to be used in the dropdown language selector and other
places in the plugin admin page.</li>
<li><code>Flag</code> : Select a flag to associate with a language. Needed for the list type of language selector.</li>
<li><code>Character Set</code> : Advanced. Most users shouldn't try to set this, but if you understand character sets and
want to have your languages use different ones, set the name here. It works best if you use the same character set,
say UTF-8, or unicode, for all languages.</li>
<li><code>Native Language</code> : Set to yes for your native language and no for all other languages.</li>
</ul>
<p>For best results, you should also download and install the Nucleus CMS language file for each language you define. This will
help translate some of the core Nucleus forms, like comment forms and login forms.

<h3><a name="def_templates">Defining Template Mappings</a></h3>

<p>NP_Text is used to provide translations in the skins and parts of the templates, but some areas like
archives and search results, as well as locale (for dates) are not. It is probably good practice on a
multi-language blog to be minimalistic to avoid the need to translate and maintain too many pieces. However,
Some things will remain after NP_Text to translate. These are in templates.</p>

<p>Before you can define template mappings, you must first create the translated templates. The best way to
do this is to clone the templates used by your skin (i.e. default/index and default/item for the item skin
and shades/index and shades/item for the shades skin). Clone each skin once for each language. Then rename
the clones in a way to identify them (i.e. default/indexFR for french, and default/indexSP for spanish, etc...).</p>

<p>Now you go through each template you cloned and renamed to translate it to the appropriate language.
Also, be sure to set the Locale field near the bottom to an appropriate locale to format and translate dates
properly for that language.<p>

<p>Finally, you will need to map the cloned templates to the original template name used by your skin.
This is done on the Templates tab of the NP_MultiLanguage admin page. Just select the original template
from the list of templates in the Add New Template field. You will be brought to a Add Template form.
Complete the form as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>Language</code> : The language that this mapping is for. Select a language from the list.</li>
<li><code>Template Name</code> : Name of the template to be used whenever you skin calls the original
template shown in the Original Value column. For example, if the original template is default/index and you
choose default/indexFR here, and french for the Language, NP_MultiLanguage will use default/indexFR for
visitors who select french wherever your skin calls for the default/index template.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="def_categories">Translating Categories</a></h3>

<p>You can give translations of your category names and descriptions into each language. The translated names
and descriptions will appear in the output of the categorylist skin variable and the output of the category
template variable</p>

<p>To translate the categories of a blog, you must have blog admin rights to that blog, i.e. only site and
blog admins can translate categories. The translations are done for the categories on the Categories tab of
the MultiLanguage admin page. If there are multiple blogs, you will be required to select the blog before
you can add or edit category translations.</p>

<p>The page will display a table with any existing category translations. The first column displays the
category id and the name of the category in the native language. The rest of the columns show information
about the translation. There are edit and delete actions for each translation. To change a translation,
click the edit link for that translation. The fields used for editing are the same as those used for adding
a translation and are described below.</p>

<p>To add a new translation, use the Add New Category dropdown field above the table of translations to
select the native category for which you wish to add a translation. Once the category is selected, you will
be taken to a translation form. On this form, you simply select the language of this translation, then
translate the category name and description in the appropriate fields. For your convenience, the native
category name and description is shown on the form.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Only the languages without a current translation for the given category will show up in the
language list. If you need to edit an existing translation, use the edit link on the main Categories tab.</p>


<h3><a name="def_items">Translating Items</a></h3>

<p>You can give translations of each of your items. The translated items will appear in the output of the
blog skin variable, as well as the output of the NP_Ordered (v1.29.02+) skin variables. Other plugins that
output items, like NP_ShowBlogs or NP_MultipleCategories will need to be modified to work with NP_MultiLanguage.</p>

<p>To translate the items of a blog, you must have blog team rights to that blog. The translations are done
for the items on the Items tab of the MultiLanguage admin page. If there are multiple blogs, you will be
required to select the blog before you can add or edit item translations.</p>

<p>The page will display a table with any existing item translations. The first column displays the native
item id of the translated item. The rest of the columns show information about the translation. There are
edit and delete actions for each translation. To change a translation, click the edit link for that
translation. The fields used for editing are the same as those used for adding a translation and are
described below.</p>

<p>To add a new translation, use the Select Item to Translate dropdown field above the table of translations to
select the native item for which you wish to add a translation. Once the item is selected, you will
be taken to a translation form. Before you are shown the form, you need to select the language of this
translation from a drop down list. Once the language is selected, you will see the translation form. You need to
provide translations of the Title, Body, and Extended fields in the appropriate fields. For your convenience,
the native values of these fields are shown on the form. The Title is at the top and the More and Extended fields
are at the bottom. You should be able to insert any html code or NucleusCMS variables in the translations as you
would the native item.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Only the languages without a current translation for the given item will show up in the
language list. If you need to edit an existing translation, use the edit link on the main Items tab.</p>
