<h3><a name="requirements">Requirements</h3>

<p>There are no requirements beyond those imposed by NucleusCMS itself. However, to use the file field type, the Nucleus Media directory ($DIR_MEDIA in config.php) must be writable by the web server.</p>

<h3><a name="upgrade">Upgrade</a></h3>
<p>Version 2 has changed much from version 1, including additional database tables and plugin options. This requires that version 1 be uninstalled before version 2 can be installed. Please follow this procedure to upgrade to version 2 from version 1.</p>
<p>Upgrading from version 2.01 to 2.02+ also requires you follow this procedure, but step 2 can be skipped.</p>
<p>Upgrading from version 2.02+ to 2.03+ does not require any special procedure. Simply copy the new files over the old files.</p>
<p>Uppgrading from version 2.0x to 2.1x requires you follow the this procedure, but step 2 can be skipped.</p>
<p>Upgrading from version 2.1x to 2.1x does not require any special procedure. Simply copy the new files over the old files.</p>
<ol>
<li>Backup your database.</li>
<li>Make a copy of your existing nucleus/plugins/NP_Profile.php file to a safe place. You will need this if you wish to revert later and to help you migrate your custom field settings to the version 2 database storage.</li>
<li>If you are currently running v 1.2 or v 1.3, you must edit your existing nucleus/plugins/NP_Profile.php file to delete the following lines:
	<pre><code>function unInstall() {
      sql_query("DROP TABLE ". sql_table(plugin_profile));
   }</code></pre> If you fail to do this step, you will lose your existing member profile data and hope you did step 1 (backed up your database).</li>
<li>Uninstall the NP_Profile plugin using the Nucleus Admin GUI.</li>
<li>Install the new NP_Profile version as described below.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="skinvars">SkinVars</a></h3>

<p>The Profile skin variable is valid in the following skin types: 'member','archive','archivelist','item','index','template'. When a member is viewing his own member page, the fields are displayed as form input fields to allow the member to update his own profile.</p>

<p>It has the general form of </p>

&lt;%Profile(<i>fieldname</i>,<i>special</i>,<i>showas</i>,<i>memberid</i>)%&gt;
where
<ul>
<li><i>fieldname</i> is the name of the field to display. By default, the valid values are h<b>nick, realname, mail,
notes, url</b>, msn, sex, birthdate, avatar, location, hobbies, secret, icq, favoritesite, bio, resume, privacylevel.
The ones in bold are Nucleus member fields and represent data kept by the Nucleus Core. More details about these special Nucleus fields will be given later. It can also be one of a number of special values such as startform, endform, password, editlink, editprofile, or status, as described later.</li>
<li><i>special</i> is one of label or show as described below (can be left blank, the default behavior):
   <ul>
   <li>label - Valid for all fields. Shows the label for the named field..</li>
   <li>show - Valid for all fields. Directs NP_Profile to display the field value in all cases (so wont show input field to member on his own page, so useful to show fields outside of member form). Will be formatted according to <i>showas</i> type, where applicable.</li>
   </ul>
<li><i>showas</i> is one of image, link, or raw, as described below (can be left blank, the default behavior):
   <ul>
   <li>image - Valid for fields of type file. Shows the file as an image for the named field. Default for file type.</li>
   <li>link - Valid for fields of type file, url, mail, list. Shows value of named field as a link. Default for url and mail types.</li>
   <li>raw - Valid for fields of type file, url, mail, list, textarea. Shows raw value of named field with no html tags. File fields show as a raw URL. Default for list types.</li>
   <li>format - Valid for fields of type text, textarea, file, list, mail, url, dropdown, radio. Shows the value using a custom format as described in the Edit Custom Field Definitions Form section below. If no custom format given, will use type default for display. If no value in field, nothing will be displayed.</li>
   </ul>
<li><i>memberid</i> is the member id (number), or member name (login name) of the member who's profile field you wish to display.
This is needed when NP_Profile cannot determine which member's info to display, such as on an index skin,
or when you want a specific member's profile field displayed.<br />
As of version 2.1, this can also be the special value of %ME% which will display the data for the logged-on member to himself. This might be used to display the member's own avatar in a sidebar or header when he is logged-on.<br />
As of version 2.15, this can be the special value of %CAT% which will display the data of the owner of the current category. To use this you must have categories with the description field set as member names to indicate the owner of the category.<br />
As of version 2.15, this can be the special value of %BLOG% which will display the data of the owner of the current blog. To use this the shortname of the blog must be the member's username.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some usage examples are given here:</p>

<p>All Profile management should be done by a user with Administrator privileges for the site. Admin users can add, modify, delete, enable, and require fields, as desired. Additionally, default attribute settings can be set for each file type.</p>
<p>Site administrators can, as of v2.13, edit the profile of all users by visiting the users member page.</p>
<p>The field and type definitions can be managed from any of two places depending on your settings, as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Your Plugins Page</b> : Full management is available by going to the Plugins page in your Nucleus Admin GUI. Click on the &lsquo;admin&rsquo; link in the right column of the row for the Profile plugin. The full management functions will be described below. This management method is always available.</li>
<li><b>Your QuickMenu</b> : If enabled, by a Plugin Option, a &lsquo;Profile&rsquo; link will appear at the bottom of the left column of your Nucleus Admin GUI, under the Plugins heading. This is a link to the same admin page as available from the Plugins Page.</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="action"></a>On the Profile Admin page, the are three tabbed areas as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>[Field Definitions]</b> : This displays the table of defined fields. New fields can be added from this page and existing fields can be edited or deleted.</li>
<li><b>[Field Types]</b> : This displays the table of defined field types. Default settings for existing field types can be edited from this page.</li>

<li><b>Format</b> : A format string indicating how the field should be displayed. Meaningful for all field types, but date, list and number require special formats as described below.</li>
	<ul>
    <li>For most field types. The format can be any string, including html code, containing the special string of %DATA% (case matters). Each occurance of %DATA% or %LABEL% will be replaced by the raw data or label, respectively, for the given field. Below the format variables are described and examples are given:</li>
        <br /><b>Format Variables:</b>
        <ul>
        <li><b>%DATA%</b> - The value of the field. For fields of type radio, dropdown, and list, this is the display value, i.e. if options are yes|1;no|0, then %DATA% would be yes or no.</li>
        <li><b>%LABEL%</b> - The label of the field.</li>
        <li><b>%VALUE%</b> - The stored value of the field. For all field types except radio, dropdown, and list, this is the same as %DATA%. For radio, dropdown, and list field types, this is the value stored in the database, i.e. if options are yes|1;no|0, then %VALUE% would be 1 or 0.</li>
        <li><b>%FIELD%</b> - The name of the field.</li>
        <li><b>%MEMBER%</b> - The login name of the member whose data is being viewed.</li>
        <li><b>%ID%</b> - The member id number of the member whose data is being viewed.</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Examples:</b>
        <ul>
        <li>&lt;a href=&quot;skype://%DATA%&quot; title=&quot;Call %MEMBER% using Skype&quot;&gt;%DATA%&lt;/a&gt; would give a link to a users skype name</li>
        <li>&lt;div class=&quot;biography&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;%LABEL%&lt;/h2&gt;%DATA%&lt;/div&gt; would put the contents of the field into a div of class biography and under a header of the field label.</li>
        </ul>
	<li>For date type fields. Format should consist of the letters M, D, and Y, separated by a character like -, or /. The order of the letters M, D, and Y will also dictate the order of input. Optionally, for more detailed formatting, a date format string can be added here by appending ?<i>format</i> to this field where <i>format</i> is a valid <a href="http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.date.php" title="PHP Date Function">php date() format</a>.For Example, if the date to display is 04 February 2007, </li>
		<ul>
		<li><i>D-M-Y</i> will display the date like 04-02-2007.</li>
		<li><i>M/D/Y</i> will display the date like 02/04/2007.</li>
		<li><i>Y-D-M</i> will display the date like 2007-04-02.</li>
		<li><i>Y/M/D</i> will display the date like 2007/02/04.</li>
        <li><i>D-M-Y?F j, Y</i> will display the date like February 4, 2007. But present the input fields like <i>day month year</i></li>
        <li><i>D-M-Y?d M Y</i> will display the date like 04 Feb 2007. And present the input fields like <i>day month year</i></li>
        <li><i>Y-M-D?Ymd</i> will display the date like 20070204. And present the input fields like <i>year month day</i></li>
		</ul>
	<li>For list type fields. Format should be like <i>tag</i>-<i>class</i>-<i>format</i>, where <i>tag</i> is one of ol,ul, or dl, and <i>class</i> is name of css class of list, and <i>format</i> is a format like above. Any of these can be blank, but the - separator must be used. See examples below.</li>
		<ul>
		<li>ul-toppinglist will display the list items as an unordered list with a class of toppinglist.</li>
        <li>ul-toppinglist-&lt;b&gt;%DATA%&lt;/b&gt; will display the list items as an unordered list with a class of toppinglist, and each list element will be bolded</li>
		<li>--&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;%DATA%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt; will display the list items inside &lt;li&gt; tags, and each list element will be bolded. The &lt;ul&gt; tags would need to be in the skin.</li>
		<li>ol-toppinglist will display the list items as an ordered list with a class of toppinglist.</li>
		<li>dl-toppinglist will display the list items as an definition list with a class of toppinglist, each list element surrounded by &lt;dd&gt; and &lt;/dd&gt; tags.</li>
		<li>(-) will surround each list element in parentheses, like (cheese)(mushrooms)(sausage).</li>
		</ul>
    <li>For number type fields. Format should be <i>places</i>-<i>decimalpoint</i>-<i>thousandsep</i> where <i>places</i> is the number of decimal places to show, <i>decimalpoint</i> is the character used for the decimal point, and <i>thousandsep</i> is the character used to spearate thousands. See examples below:</li>
        <ul>
        <li>2-.-, would display the number 12345.6789 as 12,345.67</li>
        <li>1-,-. would display the number 12345.6789 as 12.345,6</li>
        <li>0-.-, would display the number 12345.6789 as 12,345</li>
        </ul>
	</ul>
<li><b>Empty Value Format</b> : (new in 2.16) A format string indicating how the field should be displayed when the value is null. Accepts same format variables as in Format field above. Meaningful for all field types except list, dropdown, and radio.</li>

    <ul>
	<li>For fields of type dropdown, radio, list: Required for dropdown and radio. Optional for list. Sets value options presented to member for this field. Use format 'display1|value1;display2|value2' where display is what user sees and value is what gets stored. Display and store values can be the same.For example,</li>
		<ul>
        <li>'yes|1;no|0' displays yes and no to user, but stores 1 or 0, respectively.</li>
        <li>'yes|yes;no|no' displays and stores the values yes or no, respectively.</li>

    <li>For fields of type textarea: Optional. <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.</span> Sets any html tags that should be allowed in this field. &lt;br /&gt; is always permitted. Format should be a string of angle-bracketed tags like this, '&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;'. The &lt;script&gt;, &lt;style&gt;, and &lt;del&gt; tags are never permitted. This should be used with extreme caution as it may present a security risk if unsavory members use cross-site scripting techniques to send users to dangerous places.</li>
        <ul>
        <li>'&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;' allows use of the bold, italics, and underlines in your posts</li>
        <li>Again, this should not be used if you can't trust your members. Some formating tags, like b, i, and u, pose little risk, but any tags that add or present data (such as a, img, embed, etc...) can be mis-used by those with evil intentions. Do not add any tags here without being aware of the security risk it might impose.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
<li><b>Default</b> : String. Default value for fields giving choices. Valid only for list, dropdown, and radio fields. The storage value should be given. e.g. for an options field of \'yes|1;no|0\', use 1 to set default to yes and 0 to set default to 0. New to 2.1.</li>
<li><b>Public</b> : Should member data for this field be viewable by all site visitors, regardless of the privacylevel setting? Fields where this is set to yes, will display for guests even if the member has set his profile to Members Only. Fields like nick, avatar, url should be set to yes. New to 2.1.</li>
<li><b>Action to Perform</b> : Choose an action to perform: Add a new field, or Update an existing field.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Edit Type Default Settings Form</h4>

<p>When editing a field type definition, the Edit Type Default Settings form is used. Below the fields are described. The values entered here will be default values used by the fields when no field specific value is given in the field definition.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Name</b> : The name of the type. Cannot be changed.</li>
<li><b>Length</b> : Integer. Maxlength of field. # of rows for textarea.</li>
<li><b>Size</b> : Integer. Size of input field. # of columns for textarea.</li>
<li><b>Format</b> : A format string indicating how the field should be displayed. Meaningful for all field types, but date, list and number require special formats as described below.</li>
	<ul>
    <li>For most field types. The format can be any string, including html code, containing the special string of %DATA% (case matters). Each occurance of %DATA% or %LABEL% will be replaced by the raw data or label, respectively, for the given field. Below the format variables are described and examples are given:</li>
        <br /><b>Format Variables:</b>
        <ul>
        <li><b>%DATA%</b> - The value of the field. For fields of type radio, dropdown, and list, this is the display value, i.e. if options are yes|1;no|0, then %DATA% would be yes or no.</li>
        <li><b>%LABEL%</b> - The label of the field.</li>
        <li><b>%VALUE%</b> - The stored value of the field. For all field types except radio, dropdown, and list, this is the same as %DATA%. For radio, dropdown, and list field types, this is the value stored in the database, i.e. if options are yes|1;no|0, then %VALUE% would be 1 or 0.</li>
        <li><b>%FIELD%</b> - The name of the field.</li>
        <li><b>%MEMBER%</b> - The login name of the member whose data is being viewed.</li>
        <li><b>%ID%</b> - The member id number of the member whose data is being viewed.</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Examples:</b>
        <ul>
        <li>&lt;a href=&quot;skype://%DATA%&quot; title=&quot;Call %MEMBER% using Skype&quot;&gt;%DATA%&lt;/a&gt; would give a link to a users skype name</li>
        <li>&lt;div class=&quot;biography&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;%LABEL%&lt;/h2&gt;%DATA%&lt;/div&gt; would put the contents of the field into a div of class biography and under a header of the field label.</li>
        </ul>
	<li>For date type fields. Format should consist of the letters M, D, and Y, separated by a character like -, or /. The order of the letters M, D, and Y will also dictate the order of input. Optionally, for more detailed formatting, a date format string can be added here by appending ?<i>format</i> to this field where <i>format</i> is a valid <a href="http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.date.php" title="PHP Date Function">php date() format</a>.For Example, if the date to display is 04 February 2007, </li>
		<ul>
		<li><i>D-M-Y</i> will display the date like 04-02-2007.</li>
		<li><i>M/D/Y</i> will display the date like 02/04/2007.</li>
		<li><i>Y-D-M</i> will display the date like 2007-04-02.</li>
		<li><i>Y/M/D</i> will display the date like 2007/02/04.</li>
        <li><i>D-M-Y?F j, Y</i> will display the date like February 4, 2007. But present the input fields like <i>day month year</i></li>
        <li><i>D-M-Y?d M Y</i> will display the date like 04 Feb 2007. And present the input fields like <i>day month year</i></li>
        <li><i>Y-M-D?Ymd</i> will display the date like 20070204. And present the input fields like <i>year month day</i></li>
		</ul>
	<li>For list type fields. Format should be like <i>tag</i>-<i>class</i>-<i>format</i>, where <i>tag</i> is one of ol,ul, or dl, and <i>class</i> is name of css class of list, and <i>format</i> is a format like above. Any of these can be blank, but the - separator must be used. See examples below.</li>
		<ul>
		<li>ul-toppinglist will display the list items as an unordered list with a class of toppinglist.</li>
        <li>ul-toppinglist-&lt;b&gt;%DATA%&lt;/b&gt; will display the list items as an unordered list with a class of toppinglist, and each list element will be bolded</li>
		<li>--&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;%DATA%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt; will display the list items inside &lt;li&gt; tags, and each list element will be bolded. The &lt;ul&gt; tags would need to be in the skin.</li>
		<li>ol-toppinglist will display the list items as an ordered list with a class of toppinglist.</li>
		<li>dl-toppinglist will display the list items as an definition list with a class of toppinglist, each list element surrounded by &lt;dd&gt; and &lt;/dd&gt; tags.</li>
		<li>(-) will surround each list element in parentheses, like (cheese)(mushrooms)(sausage).</li>
		</ul>
    <li>For number type fields. Format should be <i>places</i>-<i>decimalpoint</i>-<i>thousandsep</i> where <i>places</i> is the number of decimal places to show, <i>decimalpoint</i> is the character used for the decimal point, and <i>thousandsep</i> is the character used to spearate thousands. See examples below:</li>
        <ul>
        <li>2-.-, would display the number 12345.6789 as 12,345.67</li>
        <li>1-,-. would display the number 12345.6789 as 12.345,6</li>
        <li>0-.-, would display the number 12345.6789 as 12,345</li>
        </ul>
	</ul>
<li><b>Empty Value Format</b> : (new in 2.16) A format string indicating how the field should be displayed when the value is null. Accepts same format variables as in Format field above. Meaningful for all field types except list, dropdown, and radio.</li>
<li><b>Width</b> : Integer. Max width of images for upload. Only valid for file type.</li>
<li><b>Height</b> : Integer. Max height of images for upload. Only valid for file type.</li>
<li><b>File Size</b> : Integer. Max file size in bytes of images for upload. Blank uses Nucleus Max Upload Size from General Settings. Only valid for file type. (Special for textarea type, max size in bytes of text area. If no value given here, default of 5000 bytes used.)</li>
<li><b>File Type</b> : Allowed file types for upload. Default types are jpg;jpeg;gif;png (use ; to separate multiple types), but any extention can be permitted. Blank uses Nucleus Allowed Types from General Settings. Only valid for file type.</li>
<li><b>Options</b> : String. Generally should not be set here, as each field will require different options. Can be used to set a default, though if the options are not set in the field definition. See the explanation of the options in the Field Definition section above.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Edit Form Configuration Settings Form</h4>

<p>This page allows the setting of miscelleneous profile configuration settings. This is new to version 2.1 and presently only has one configuration setting &emdash; editprofile.</p>

<p><b>editprofile</b> controls the format of the editprofile page which is a new page for the member settings form. Previously this form had to be part of the member details page. The formatting of the page is flexible and can be divided into up to 10 tabs. If this field is left blank, the editprofile page will display a form with all enabled fields listed alphabetically. The formatting options are detailed below.</p>

<b>Example of editprofile formatting</b>
<p>This is the intial value of the editprofile field. It is displayed here as an example of the formatting. Five tabs are used to section the member data input.</p>
# This configures the format of the editprofile page. See help.html for formatting options.<br />
# First set tabs and labels. (tab0 must always be for NP_Profile) only tabs 0-9 allowed<br />
[t]<br />
[t0]Personal<br />
[t1]Contact<br />
[t2]Bio<br />
[t3]Interests<br />
[t4]Password<br />
[/t]<br />
# Now give format of tab 0<br />
[0]<br />
startform<br />
[h3]Personal<br />
nick<br />
realname<br />
sex<br />
birthdate<br />
location<br />

# In the future you will be able to add forms for NP_Profile extension plugins.<br />
# The means employed to specify and retirieve the code for these forms is not yout determined.<br />
# Under consideration are requiring the extension plugin to have a method called editProfileForm()<br />
# which outputs a complete form for modifying its settings. Or by calling skinvars that create the form<br />
# while assuming a skintype of member<br />

<ul>
<li><b>[t]</b> : opens the tab configuration section.</li>
<li><b>[/t]</b> : closes the tab configuration section.</li>
<li><b>[tX]</b> : where X is an integer between 0 and 9. Sets the label on tab number X. X should start with 0 and be consecutive.</li>
<li><b>[X]</b> : where X is an integer between 0 and 9. opens the configuration section for tab number X.</li>
<li><b>[/X]</b> : where X is an integer between 0 and 9. closes the configuration section for tab number X.</li>
<li><b>[hY]</b> : where Y is an integer between 1 and 6. Inserts a heading into the form. [h1] inserts a level 1 header and [h3] inserts a third level header.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the configuration section for any tab number, you can insert the fieldname of any profile field, including the special field names (startform, endform, status, submitbutton). Generally, you should use startform and endform to frame the fieldnames to ensure the form is generated correctly. The submitbutton fieldname can be used to add a submit button to a place other than the end of the form. The password fieldname should be used outside of the regular startform-endform block, as it creates a separate form.</p>

<h3><a name="tips">Tips and Tricks</a></h3>

<p>This plugin is very configurable and customizable, so not all uses are fully documented here. Feel free to experiment and share things that work with other users
at the support forum thread: <a href="http://forum.nucleuscms.org/viewtopic.php?t=13827">http://forum.nucleuscms.org/viewtopic.php?t=13827</a>. Here are a few ideas that might get your imagination started:</p>
<ul>
<li>In your Item Pages skin part, put the author avatar and bio at the end of the page like this:(Could also go in the Item Body field of your item template)</li>
<pre>&lt;div class="authorbio"&gt;
&lt;%Profile(avatar,show,image)%&gt;&lt;%Profile(realname)%&gt; &amp;mdash; &lt;%Profile(bio,,raw)%&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<li>In your index template, Item Body field, insert this to display the item author's avatar next to each item title:</li>
<pre>&lt;%Profile(avatar,show,image)%&gt;</pre>
<li>Create a file type field called vitae and permit pdf files. Now the user can upload his resume as a PDF file,
and you can display a link to it on the Member Page like this: (or in templates, or in Item Pages skins)</li>
<pre>&lt;%Profile(vitae,show,link)%&gt;</pre>
<li>Using the same field, you want your resume link in the sidebar of all pages, add this to your sidebar:</li>
<pre>&lt;%Profile(vitae,show,link,yourname)%&gt;</pre>
<li>You want some profile fields only visible to logged-in members, use the &lt;%if(loggedin)%&gt; skinvar like this:</li>
<pre>...public profile fields displayed here...
&lt;%if(loggedin)%&gt;
   ...private profile fields displayed here...
&lt;%endif%&gt;</pre>

</ul>
<h3><a name="future">Future Plans</a></h3>

<p>Some added features under consideration, if there is interest, are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>More field validation options, i.e. isEmail, isURL, isLength, isStrongPassword, etc...</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="support">Support and Bug reports</a></h3>
