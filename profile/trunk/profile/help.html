<h3><a name="requirements">Requirements</h3>

<p>There are no requirements beyond those imposed by NucleusCMS itself. However, to use the file field type, the Nucleus Media directory ($DIR_MEDIA in config.php) must be writable by the web server.</p>

<h3><a name="upgrade">Upgrade</a></h3>
<p>Version 2 has changed much from version 1, including additional database tables and plugin options. This requires that version 1 be uninstalled before version 2 can be installed. Please follow this procedure to upgrade to version 2 from version 1.</p>
<p>Upgrading from version 2.01 to 2.02 or higher also requires you follow this procedure, but step 2 can be skipped.</p>
<ol>
<li>Backup your database.</li>
<li>Make a copy of your existing nucleus/plugins/NP_Profile.php file to a safe place. You will need this if you wish to revert later and to help you migrate your custom field settings to the version 2 database storage.</li>
<li>If you are currently running v 1.2 or v 1.3, you must edit your existing nucleus/plugins/NP_Profile.php file to delete the following lines:
	<pre><code>function unInstall() {
      sql_query("DROP TABLE ". sql_table(plugin_profile));
   }</code></pre> If you fail to do this step, you will lose your existing member profile data and hope you did step 1 (backed up your database).</li>
<li>Uninstall the NP_Profile plugin using the Nucleus Admin GUI.</li>
<li>Install the new NP_Profile version as described below.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="installation">Installation</a></h3>

<p>The NP_Profile plugin can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.iai.com/NP_Profile.zip" title="Download NP_Profile">here</a>.</p>

<p>Download and extract the zip file. Copy the NP_Profile.php file and the profile directory to the nucleus/plugins directory.</p>

<p>Use the Nucleus Admin GUI to register the NP_Profile plugin into Nucleus. Be sure to click the &lsquo;Update subscription list&rsquo; button.</p>

<p>You will need to edit and save the plugin options before using the plugin. The options are described below.</p>

<h3><a name="options">Plugin Options</a></h3>
<p>There are a number of options that control the operation of the Profile plugin. These options are set from the &lsquo;edit options&rsquo; link in the Plugin Admin area. The options are described below.</p>

</ul>

<h3><a name="skinvars">SkinVars</a></h3>

<p>The Profile skin variable is valid in the following skin types: 'member','archive','archivelist','item','index','template'. When a member is viewing his own member page, the fields are displayed as form input fields to allow the member to update his own profile.</p>

<p>It has the general form of </p>

&lt;%Profile(<i>fieldname</i>,<i>special</i>,<i>showas</i>,<i>memberid</i>)%&gt;
where
<ul>
<li><i>fieldname</i> is the name of the field to display. By default, the valid values are h<b>nick, realname, mail,
notes, url</b>, msn, sex, birthdate, avatar, location, hobbies, secret, icq, favoritesite, bio, resume.
The ones in bold are Nucleus member fields and represent data kept by the Nucleus Core. More details about these special Nucleus fields will be given later. It can also be one of a number of special values such as startform, endform, password, or status, as described later.</li>
<li><i>special</i> is one of label or show as described below (can be left blank, the default behavior):
   <ul>
   <li>label - Valid for all fields. Shows the label for the named field..</li>
   <li>show - Valid for all fields. Directs NP_Profile to display the field value in all cases (so wont show input field to member on his own page, so useful to show fields outside of member form). Will be formatted according to <i>showas</i> type, where applicable.</li>
   </ul>
<li><i>showas</i> is one of image, link, or raw, as described below (can be left blank, the default behavior):
   <ul>
   <li>image - Valid for fields of type file. Shows the file as an image for the named field. Default for file type.</li>
   <li>link - Valid for fields of type file, url, mail, list. Shows value of named field as a link. Default for url and mail types.</li>
   <li>raw - Valid for fields of type file, url, mail, list, textarea. Shows raw value of named field with no html tags. File fields show as a raw URL. Default for list types.</li>
   </ul>
<li><i>memberid</i> is the member id (number), or member name (login name) of the member who's profile field you wish to display.
This is needed when NP_Profile cannot determine which member's info to display, such as on an index skin,
or when you want a specific member's profile field displayed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some usage examples are given here:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>&lt;%Profile(realname)%&gt;</b> will, on a member page, display the real name of the member whose page is being viewed.
On an item page or in a template (see TemplateVar below) will show the real name of the item's author. On other skin types, it will display nothing.</li>
<li><b>&lt;%Profile(realname, , ,2)%&gt;</b> will display the real name of member 2 on all skin types.</li>
<li><b>&lt;%Profile(avatar)%&gt;</b> will display the input field for an avatar file.</li>
<li><b>&lt;%Profile(avatar,show,image)%&gt;</b> will, on a member page, display the avatar, as an image, of the member whose page is being viewed. On an item page or in a template (see TemplateVar below) will show the avatar, as an image, of the item's author. On other skin types, it will display nothing.</li>
<li><b>&lt;%Profile(avatar,show,image,jsmith)%&gt;</b> will display the avatar, as an image, of member jsmith on all pages.</li>
<li><b>&lt;%Profile(password)%&gt;</b> will show a change password form only if a member is viewing his own member page. Otherwise, it displays nothing.</li>
<li><b>&lt;%Profile(startform)%&gt;</b> will add the html needed to start an input form for members, but only if a member is viewing his own member page. Otherwise, it displays nothing. Must be used on Member Details skin part if members will be allowed to edit their own profiles.</li>
<li><b>&lt;%Profile(endform)%&gt;</b> will add the html needed to end an input form for members, but only if a member is viewing his own member page. Otherwise, it displays nothing. Must be used on Member Details skin part if members will be allowed to edit their own profiles.</li>
<li><b>&lt;%Profile(editlink)%&gt;</b> will add the html needed to display a link to the profile edit form, but only if a member is viewing his own member page. Otherwise, it displays nothing. Should be used on Member Details skin part if members will be allowed to edit their own profiles.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="templatevars">TemplateVars</a></h3>

<h3><a name="tips">Tips and Tricks</a></h3>

<p>This plugin is very configurable and customizable, so not all uses are fully documented here. Feel free to experiment and share things that work with other users
at the support forum thread: <a href="http://forum.nucleuscms.org/viewtopic.php?t=13827">http://forum.nucleuscms.org/viewtopic.php?t=13827</a>. Here are a few ideas that might get your imagination started:</p>
<ul>
<li>In your Item Pages skin part, put the author avatar and bio at the end of the page like this:(Could also go in the Item Body field of your item template)</li>
<pre>&lt;div class="authorbio"&gt;
&lt;%Profile(avatar,show,image)%&gt;&lt;%Profile(realname)%&gt; &amp;mdash; &lt;%Profile(bio,,raw)%&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<li>In your index template, Item Body field, insert this to display the item author's avatar next to each item title:</li>
<pre>&lt;%Profile(avatar,show,image)%&gt;</pre>
<li>Create a file type field called vitae and permit pdf files. Now the user can upload his resume as a PDF file,
and you can display a link to it on the Member Page like this: (or in templates, or in Item Pages skins)</li>
<pre>&lt;%Profile(vitae,show,link)%&gt;</pre>
<li>Using the same field, you want your resume link in the sidebar of all pages, add this to your sidebar:</li>
<pre>&lt;%Profile(vitae,show,link,yourname)%&gt;</pre>
<li>You want some profile fields only visible to logged-in members, use the &lt;%if(loggedin)%&gt; skinvar like this:</li>
<pre>...public profile fields displayed here...
&lt;%if(loggedin)%&gt;
   ...private profile fields displayed here...
&lt;%endif%&gt;</pre>

</ul>
<h3><a name="future">Future Plans</a></h3>

<p>Some added features under consideration, if there is interest, are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>More field validation options, i.e. isEmail, isURL, isLength, isStrongPassword, etc...</li>
</ul>
