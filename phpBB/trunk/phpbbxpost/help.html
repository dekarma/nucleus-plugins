<h3>Plugin overview</h3>

<p>The purpose of this plugin is provide a linkage between Nucleus CMS and the phpBB forum software.  This plugin provides the ability to cross-post weblog entries to the associated phpBB instalation.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>Instalation of the plugin is a multi-step process, of which you are likely on step 4.</p>

<ol><li>Download the NP_phpBB.zip file, and upload the contents to the plugins directory of your nucleus instalation.</li>
<li>Install the phpBB plugin, per its instructions</li>
<li>From the Nucleus Plugins screen, install this plugin.</li>
<li>Update your nucleus instalation.  This plugin requires a newer version of ITEM.php than is available in the 3.2/3.21 release.  You can be daring and use the CVS version of nucleus, or you can go the safe route and pull this file from the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/nucleuscms/nucleus/nucleus/libs/ITEM.php?rev=1.18">SourceForge CVS viewer</a>.</li> 
<li>Start configuring the plugin by going to the 'Plugins' page, then the 'edit options' screen for the phpBB crosspost plugin.  A number of options will need to be configured, and the decisions that need to be made are detailed below.</li>
<li>Select a forum to cross-post to.  For security reasons, a single forum is used for all cross-posts.  Enter the ID number for this in the coresponding text field.</li>
<li>Decide how to handle forum permissions.  This plugin allows you control whether it will ignore or respect posting restrictions for thread creation, editing and deletion.  This behavior is controlled by the trio of radio buttons named like 'Ignore phpBB <i>foo</i> restrictions?' and is fine-grained enough that you can ignore for some commands while ignoring for others, but is too corse to provide member by member control.  If an ignore option is set to yes, the plugin will ignore all restrictions placed on the coresponding option, including the locking of the forum in question. This may be desired for deletion, but likely isn't desired for create or edit.</li>
<li>Decide how much freedom users have over the appearance of their cross-posts.  The plugin is able to cross post the post body, extended body, and reference link, along with embeding images into the cross-post.  Users may be permitted to control the behavior exhibitied, or they may be restricted to the defaults selected, but this can't be controlled on a member by member basis.  The user control is determined with the 'Allow users to override cross post content options?' option, and the next four options determining the defaults.</li>
<li>The final option is only of use when preparing to uninstall the plugin.  If set to yes, the internal table used to associate nucleus posts with phpBB posts will be dropped (deleted), removing this information.  If you are perminently removing the table, this is desired, but this would not be desired if you are upgrading to a newer version or are planing to reinstall the plugin.  This should normally be left on 'no'.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Skinvars</h3>
<h4>Template variable (&lt;%phpBBxpost%&gt;)</h4>
<p>This template variable uses the 'No Comments', 'Comments Too much', 'One Comment' and 'Two (or more) Comments' template variables for the skin to generate a list of the number of forum responses to the cross-posted item.  To use, alter the 'Item Body' template variable for the skins to use this variable rather than the normal '&lt;%comments%&gt;' variable.  You can figure out which templates need to be altered by looking at the 'Item Page' and 'Main Index' skin parts, and locating the paramater passed to the '&lt;%item()%&gt;' and '&lt;%blog()%&gt;' skin variables.</p>
