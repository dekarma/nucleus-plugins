<h3>Skin variables</h3>

<p>
	<code>&lt;%TrackBack(list)%&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>
	Show a list of trackbacks for the current page. Optionally it is also possible to
	add an additional parameter, the story id number, which makes it possible to
	show a list of trackbacks from a different page. The output of this variable is
	fully configurable in the plugin options.
</p>

<p>
	<code>&lt;%TrackBack(code)%&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>
	Inserts a small piece of invisible RDF code in the page, which is used by other
	weblogs to auto-detect the trackback URL. If you do not include this variable in
	your skin for item pages, other weblogs will not be able to auto-detect that your
	weblog is able to accept trackbacks.
</p>

<p>
	<code>&lt;%TrackBack(form)%&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>
	Insert the URL to a manual ping form. Using this form authors of other weblogs
	can add trackbacks to your stories, even when their software does not support
	trackbacks, such as Blogger. A link to this form is included in the footer of
	the trackback list by default. If you want to place this link somewhere else 
	on your page, simply remove the <code>&lt;%form%&gt;</code> variable from the 
	<em>Footer</em> field in the plugin settings and add the skinvar somewhere on
	your webpage.
</p>

<p>
	<code>&lt;%TrackBack(url)%&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>
	Insert the Trackback Ping URL. A this URL is also included in the footer of
	the trackback list by default. If you want to place this link somewhere else 
	on your page, simply remove the <code>&lt;%action%&gt;</code> variable from the 
	<em>Footer</em> field in the plugin settings and add the skinvar somewhere on
	your webpage.
</p>
	
<h3>Template variables</h3>

<p>
	All the skin variables documented above are also available as template variables.
</p>

<p>
	<code>&lt;%TrackBack(count)%&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>
	If you want to include an indication of how many trackbacks are present for each
	page you can use this variable. By default this variable will show: "No Trackbacks", 
	"1 Trackback", "2 Trackbacks", etc. This is however also fully configurable in
	the plugin options.
</p>


<h3>Changing the output</h3>

<p>
	It is possible to fully change the output of this plugin. You can manually change
	the XHTML code in the plugin options, but you can also use CSS to style the default
	output to your liking. Below you will find an example of what a little snippet of
	CSS can do.

<pre>div.tb {
	border: 1px solid #000; background: #FFF;
}
div.tb div.head {
	padding: 4px;
	background: #000; color: #FFF;
