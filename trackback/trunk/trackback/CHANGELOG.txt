	2.0a  	Release by Niels Leenheer (rakaz)
			-  Added: Caching of auto-detected trackback URLs in a database table
			-  Added: If the cURL extension is present a HEAD request is send first, to make
			   sure we are dealing with a (X)HTML page and not some large binary file format.
		 	-  Added: The auto-detection of trackback URLs now happen in real time - as you type -
			   thanks to client-side Javascript and the XmlHttpRequest object which requests
			   the required data from the plugin.
	
	2.0b	-  Added spinning auto-detection indicator
		    -  Added support for multiple character encoding methods. The plugin
		   	   works internally fully in UTF-8 (Unicode) and can convert other
			   character encodings. The output of the plugin is in UTF-8 or in US-ASCII
			   with unicode characters encoded using numeric entities.
			-  Added spam protection using the Blacklist plugin (thanks to Xiffy for
			   helping me out by adding a generic spam check API to his plugin).
			-  Added a check to see if the page which send the trackback actually
			   contains a link to our server. If not, then it is probably a spamming
			   attempt and block by default.
			-  The output of this plugin is now fully configurable. You can specify
			   you're own (X)HTML code.
			-  Added a admin interface which can be used to manage trackbacks and 
			   manually send trackbacks to other sites. It is possible to delete 
			   trackbacks, but also to block and unblock trackbacks. All trackbacks
			   which are marked as spam are not deleted automatically, but they end
			   up in a list called 'Blocked trackbacks'. You can manually verify this
			   list and unblock any trackback which is marked as spam by mistake.
			-  Fixed a number of bugs, including missing hostnames and double // in
			   URLs. Fixed a bug introduced in 2.0a which prevented the title and 
			   excerpt from showing up when sending trackbacks from a newly created
			   story. Also filtering of tags is more stringent.
			   
			-  REMOVED: Manual ping forms. The form which is need to ping other
			   weblogs is now integrated into the admin interface. The form needed
			   for other weblog authors to manually add trackbacks to your website
			   will return in the next release.
			-  REMOVED: The ability to show a list of trackbacks in a popup window.
			   This will probably return in the next release.
			-  REMOVED: The ability to delete trackbacks directly from the list
			   shown to administrators. This is now handled by the admin interface.

	2.0	final	
			-  Made the help page Nucleus 3.2 compatible
			-  Added a manual ping form, which allows weblog authors to add a trackback
			   to your stories even when their software doesn't support trackbacks.
			-  Removed <language>en</language> from the RSS output, because we can't
			   be sure about the language of the contents of the RSS stream.

	2.0.1	-  Security fix: Plugin admin interface was exposed to all logged in users,
			   not only to users with admin rights.

	2.0.2	-  Added autodetection of the encoding of trackbacks, which is needed when
			   a trackback is send in a foreign encoding by a sender which does not 
			   support version 1.2 of the trackback specifications. Supported encodings:
			   US-ASCII, ISO-2022-JP, UTF-8, EUC-JP, Shift_JIS. If the encoding is not
			   specified according to version 1.2 of the specs AND it is not one of the
			   encodings specified above, the plugin will assume it is encoding using
			   ISO-8859-1.
			-  Added two new events SendTrackback and RetrieveTrackback which can be
			   used by other plugins or the XML-RPC APIs to allow external blog editors
			   to send trackbacks. (This functionality does require a modification to
			   the XML-RPC APIs).
			-  Added support for more clean Trackback URLs, for example:
			   http://www.rakaz.nl/nucleus/item/84.trackback  or 
			   http://www.rakaz.nl/nucleus/item.php?id=84&format=trackback
			   
	2.0.3   -  Added support for a more advanced version of the SpamCheck API

        2.1.0 (admun)
                -  Added delete all blocked trackback function in admin menu
		-  Harden tb URL, add tbkey which timeout and ignore unknown
		   tb ping (likely spams), tb key can be clear via cleankey
		   action type, key valid for ~3 hours
		-  Fixed send ping blocked by NP_BB
		-  re-instate ping form for item to allow user to manually
		   ping another post (which url, etc are automactically
		   filled)
