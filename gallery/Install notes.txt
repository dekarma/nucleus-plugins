NP_gallery

See bottom for version history.
Current release is 0.77 (5-4-05)

To Upgrade:
 -- To upgrade from 0.61, run np_gallery_update061.php in your base nucleus directory
 -- To upgrade from 0.75, run np_gallery_update075.php
 -- Delete both np_gallery_update files

To install:
1. make a skin called NPGallery with a call to <%gallery%> in it. For example mine looks like this:
	<%ExtraSkin(header2)%>
	<div id="contents">
	   <%gallery%>
	</div>
	<%ExtraSkin(menu2)%>
	<%ExtraSkin(footer2)%>

2. Create a link to the gallery in another skin with the skinvar <%gallery(link)%>, i.e. with this code: <a href="<%gallery(link)%>">Gallery</a>.

3. upload the files in the zip to your webserver into the base directory (add_picture.php should be in the same directory as your index.php)

4. create the folder media/gallery and make it writable (chmod 0777 or 0755)

5. add the following to your CSS file:
		#NPG_gallery {
			margin-top: 5px;
			margin-bottom: 5px;
			padding-left: 5px;
			padding-right: 5px;
			position:relative;
		}

		/*thumbnails are displayed as a 'list'*/
		ul.thumbnail {list-style: none;}
		
		ul.thumbnail li {
			float: left; 
			width: 115px; 
			height: 140px;
			padding: 10px;
			margin: 10px;
			background-color: rgb(225,225,225);
		} 
	
		/*thumbnail container*/
		#NPG_thumbnail {
			margin-top: 5px;
			margin-bottom: 5px;
			padding-left: 5px;
			padding-right: 5px;
			position:relative;
		}
		/*footer container -- used so that the footer contents are actually displayed below the thumbnails, without clear:both the footer is displayed under the thumbnails*/
		#NPG_footer {
			clear:both;
		}

 
6. install the plugin

7. play around with it and let me know what you think.
